This TypeScript code snippet extends the NextAuth.js library's type definitions for User and Session objects. Let's break down what it does and why it's used:

**Purpose:**

The primary purpose is to add custom properties to the `User` and `Session` objects used by NextAuth.js. This allows you to store and access additional user-related information beyond the defaults provided by NextAuth.js. In this specific case, it adds `id`, `email`, and `role` properties.

**Explanation:**

1. **`import { DefaultSession, DefaultUser } from "next-auth";`**: This line imports the default `Session` and `User` interfaces from the `next-auth` library. These are the base interfaces that you're extending.

2. **`declare module "next-auth" { ... }`**: This is a TypeScript declaration merging. It allows you to add new declarations to existing interfaces or types defined in other modules (in this case, the `next-auth` module). This is crucial because you're modifying types from a library without directly changing the library's source code.

3. **`interface User extends DefaultUser { ... }`**: This defines a new interface `User` that _extends_ the `DefaultUser` interface. This means it inherits all the properties of `DefaultUser` and adds the following custom properties:

   - `id: string;`: A string representing the user's unique ID. This is essential as often, you'll want to use your own database IDs instead of relying on potentially different IDs provided by auth providers.
   - `email: string;`: The user's email address. While NextAuth might already have email, explicitly defining it here reinforces the type and makes it easier to work with.
   - `role?: string;`: An optional string representing the user's role (e.g., "admin", "editor", "user"). The `?` makes it optional.

4. **`interface Session extends DefaultSession { ... }`**: This defines a new interface `Session` that _extends_ the `DefaultSession` interface. It modifies the `user` property of the session.
   - `user: User & DefaultSession["user"];`: This is the key part. It ensures that the `user` property within the `Session` object has _both_ the properties defined in your custom `User` interface _and_ the properties of the default `User` object from NextAuth.js. The `&` symbol creates an intersection type. This is important so you don't lose any default NextAuth.js user properties.

**In Summary:**

This code snippet customizes the NextAuth.js types to include additional user information (ID, email, and role) within the session. This allows you to easily access these properties throughout your application after a user logs in. It's a standard practice when working with NextAuth.js and needing to store more user data than the basic profile information. It leverages TypeScript's declaration merging to achieve this without modifying the original `next-auth` library code.
